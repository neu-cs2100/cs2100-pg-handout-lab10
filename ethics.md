This lab contains the last two out of four ethics-related questions in Homework 9.
It may be useful to refresh your memory of last week's lab's ethics question for context on measuring distance.

### Fairness

Traveling by public transportation costs different amounts of money, depending on
how far you're going. Additionally, passengers with low incomes can
receive discounted tickets.

What if we defined the edge weight between two stations as 1/n, where n
is the revenue from ticket sales from passengers travelling between
those two stations?

_How would you ensure that it still services all communities, including
those with less money?_

### Climate change

We want to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions from cars
driving on the roads. Let's assume that car drivers will switch to public transportation if it
is more convenient than driving.

_What definition could we use for the edge weights such that the MST will
select a system of train tracks that would reduce the number of cars on the
road?_
