This lab contains parts of the ethics-related questions in Homework 8.


### Question 1: robots.txt

Search online for a file called robots.txt. What is the intention of this file? Is it enforced?

### Question 2: Stakeholder-value matrix

Please create a stakeholder-value matrix for a product which requires scraping the 
internet at large. Please include at least five stakeholders and at least five values.
Assume that the scraped data is being used for a product for users, such as a generative
AI model.

It is recommended (but not required) that one of the stakeholders be bloggers from more
than ten years ago, and that one of the values is avoiding intellectual property theft.
