"""
Please implement the powerset() function below according to the comments.
You will need to write the documentation.

You will need to either add a recursive helper function or add another 
parameter to powerset() with a default value (like current: set[int] = set()).
"""


def powerset(inp: set[int]) -> None:
    # Print all possible subsets of inp, each on one line.
    # For example, powerset(set([1, 2, 3])) should print:
    # []
    # [1]
    # [2]
    # [3]
    # [1,2]
    # [1,3]
    # [2,3]
    # [1,2,3]
    # It's okay if the lines are in a different order, as long as all of them are there. Notice that the empty set is included.
